Purpose:
This application deploys a dashboard that uses financial modeling tools to forecast outcomes for the Olympic Games.

We are creating interactive data vizualizations for the following:

- Overall medal count

- Zooming in on a select event and creating a forecasting toolset for it

- Performing a comparative analysis of our financial model to the current predictive model of a popular sports-betting website
