# Olympics_Forecasting_Dashboard
This application deploys a dashboard that uses financial modeling tools to forecast outcomes for the Olympic Games. It uses that data to project booksmakers odds charts for betting and compares it to popular betting websites odds.  The application charts the final medal counts for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics with an overlay of the application predictions.

This application is well suited for predicting not only Olympic games, but any sporting event that has historical data.
